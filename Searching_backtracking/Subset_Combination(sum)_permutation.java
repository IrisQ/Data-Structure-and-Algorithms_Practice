/**
 * 1. Lintcode-Permutations
 * Given a list of numbers, return all possible permutations. eg:[1, 2, 3]
 
 * 2. Lintcode-Permutations II
 * Given a list of numbers, return all possible permutations. eg: [1, 2, 2]
 
 * 78. Subsets
 * Given a set of [distinct] integers, nums, return all possible subsets.eg:[1, 2, 3]

 * 90. Subsets II
 * not distinct integers, [may contain duplicates], return all possible subsets.eg:[1, 2, 2]
 
 * 77. Combinations
 * Given two integers n and k, return all possible combinations of k numbers out of 1 ... n.
 
 * 39. Combination Sum
 * Given a set of candidate numbers (C) (without duplicates) and a target number (T), 
 * find all unique combinations in C where the candidate numbers sums to T.
 * The same repeated number may be chosen from C unlimited number of times.
 
 * 40. Combination Sum II
 * Each number in C may only be used once in the combination.
 
 * 216. Combination Sum III
 * Find all possible combinations of k numbers that add up to a number n, given that only numbers 
 * from 1 to 9 can be used and each combination should be a unique set of numbers.

 * 377. Combination Sum IV
 * Given an integer array with all positive numbers and no duplicates, find the number of 
 * possible combinations that add up to a positive integer target
